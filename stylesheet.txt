Overall Look and Feel of the Website:

We want the website to have a simplistic yet sleek look, avoiding anything 3-D and staying away from rounded edges
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Colours:

We decided to go with blues and grays, as those represented cold colours, which was something we decided looked more 
sophisticated.

Iconography:

We wanted the icon to have a sleek feel to it as well, as opposed to something more 3-D. It is a very
simplistic icon, which fits with our overall goal.

Typography: 

We are using Hallo Sans for our website

Buttons:

Buttons will be the colours described above, and 2 dimensional, changing colours when hovered over.
